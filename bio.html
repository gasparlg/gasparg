<p>I have lived and studied in Argentina, United States, and for the last 4 years, in France, where I graduated from university obtaining a Bachelorâ€™s degree in International Business with a specialization in Global Management.</p>
        <p>My work experience proceeds from working in the hospitality industry, having experience in both public and private sectors, and from the news media industry, working as a journalist and researcher focused on the wine industry. </p>
        <p>My education has also been shaped by having grown up in a multicultural family and having traveled the world to 4 continents visiting more than 20 countries. This has provided me with a comprehensive cultural richness and experience background that benefits me when observing situations and opportunities from different perspectives, and helps me to create solutions and strategies with creativity and innovation.</p>
        <p>My competitiveness and curiosity pushes me forward in a highly competitive global market as I strive to continue building my international career and I look forward to future business challenges.</p>

        <p>As well as being a risk taker in business I also set out for adventurous travel experiences, having quite a few stories to tell, from crossing the Andes mountains on a skateboard to exploring the scenic countryside of Norway, and having all too many near-death experiences snowboarding in the alps.</p>
        <p>Also, in my free time, I enjoy playing sports among friends, improving my computer skills, like the Adobe Creative Cloud softwares, and catching up with coding, (ex: this website!).</p>
